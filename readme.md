This is my  Chocolate Cake Recipe.

BAKING TIPS :-

1] Before making this eggless chocolate cake, make sure you line your baking tin with parchment paper. If you don’t have parchment paper, you can brush the pan generously with melted butter/ oil.
2] Make sure all your ingredients, including milk, are at room temperature. This is important because room temperature ingredients emulsify better.
3] While combining dry and wet ingredients, be sure to NOT over-mix. By over-mixing, you will knock out all the air and land up with a dense cake. Simply use an offset spatula and gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.
4] I add vinegar to the milk before adding it to the batter because it makes the cake softer but if you don’t have white vinegar you can skip that.
5] Let the cake cool completely before you start frosting it.

You can eat this cake as it is or top it with frosting. You can either use a vanilla bean buttercream frosting or cream-cheese frosting. Happy Baking!
